# IN this internship I will apply solution on problems in Ml like supervised and unsupervised learning 

## Every algorithm we use in sickitlearn we will implement it from scrach
this project focus on comparison between built in Ml algorithms and implementing these ML algorithms from scrach

*  it  we will show in which use cases we use this algorithm
*  how can you modify in it to achieve your goals 
*  this comparison will make your understanding better
